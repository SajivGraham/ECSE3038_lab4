### This lab is meant to get students more accustomed to the technologies used in designing and implementing a RESTful API server.






# Cont.d From Lab 2
### The specifications have shifted slightly since the last developer meeting. Your client's budget recently increased and now they're able to pay for a database service. You've done your research and found that PostgreSQL is the most suitable database platform for the project. With this new information, the client has asked that you modify the API server to store all Tank related data to be stored in the database. The Profile data can be handled the same way as it was originally implemented, where the profile data is saved in a variable on the server.
